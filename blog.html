        <h1 class="q">What is Biodiversity?</h1>
        <p class="ans">
          Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, including the
          diversity of species, ecosystems, and genetic variations. It is
          essential for maintaining the balance of our planet's ecosystems and
          provides numerous benefits to humanity, such as clean air and water,
          food security, and climate regulation.
        </p>
        <h1 class="q">what are the types of biodiversity?</h1>
        <p class="ans">
          Biodiversity can be categorized into three main types:
          <strong><a href="">genetic diversity</a></strong
          >, which refers to the variety of genes within a species;
          <strong><a href="">species diversity</a></strong
          >, which is the variety of species within a given area; and
          <strong><a href="">ecosystem diversity</a></strong
          >, which encompasses the different habitats and ecological processes
          that support life on Earth.
        </p>
        <h1 class="q">Why is Biodiversity Important?</h1>
        <p class="ans">
          Biodiversity is crucial for the health of our planet. It supports
          ecosystem services that are vital for human survival, such as
          pollination of crops, decomposition of waste, and regulation of the
          climate. A rich biodiversity also enhances resilience against
          environmental changes and diseases.
        </p>
        <h1 class="q">How Can You Help?</h1>
        <p class="ans">
          You can contribute to biodiversity conservation in many ways. Simple
          actions like reducing waste, conserving water, planting native
          species, and supporting sustainable practices can make a significant
          difference. Additionally, you can get involved with local conservation
          groups or donate to organizations dedicated to protecting
          biodiversity.
        </p>
        <h1 class="q">what is the current status of biodiversity?</h1>
        <p class="ans">
          Biodiversity is currently facing significant threats due to human
          activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, and
          overexploitation of resources. Many species are at risk of extinction,
          and ecosystems are being degraded at an alarming rate. Conservation
          efforts are crucial to halt this decline and restore the health of our
          planet.

        <h1 id="type1" class="type">Genetic Bio-Diversity</h1>
        <p class="type-ans">
          Genetic diversity refers to the variety of genes within a species.
          This means differences in DNA among individuals of the same species.
          These genetic differences allow species to adapt to changing
          environments and resist diseases.
